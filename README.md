# Coding

This game began as an attempt to make a side scrolling  game. However, we encountered difficulties along the way and changed our game idea.
For the first month or so, we struggled to draw rectangles on the screen, and encountered little progress. Then we changed the
priority in which to make our game. We decided to make the working game first, and then make the start screen. Once this was done, we tried
to link the button to the main game loop.
